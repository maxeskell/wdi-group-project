<h2> Versioning </h2>
Current version is 1.0.  We plan to release v1.1 in the near future with the following enhancements:
<ul>
<li> An improved trails page that zooms to show the user on the map, their nearest five routes, and proximity distance of those walks from their current location </li>
<li> New sliders on to the trails page that filter walks by: distance to current location, trail length & difficulty </li>
<li> Accessibility information provided on all routes. Users will be able to record whether it is good for walking, cycling, wheelchairs and prams </li>
<li> Enhanced trail creation and edit pages that allow users to add tags to their route based on the wildlife that can expect to see on their route. Users can then also filter trails based on wildlife that want to see </li>
<li> Improved comments section that allows people to upload images to go with their comment (e.g. wildlife they saw) </li>
<li>  New profile page that will enable people to edit their user profile </li>
<li> Inclusion of the Unsplash API so if people have difficulty uploading or don't want to upload a picture, they can submit a photo from the API instead </li>
